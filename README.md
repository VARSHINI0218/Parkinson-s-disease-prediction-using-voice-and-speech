This project introduces a novel method for predicting Parkinson's disease (PD) by integrating 
voice and speech analysis, marking an improvement over traditional approaches that rely solely 
on vocal data. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects both motor and 
non-motor functions, including speech and communication. Early detection is essential for 
effective disease management, yet current diagnostic techniques often fall short in delivering 
timely and accurate assessments. By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze 
both vocal characteristics (such as pitch variability) and speech features (like speech rate and 
vocal intensity), this framework offers a more comprehensive evaluation of PD-related 
communication impairments.The system is designed with a user-friendly interface built on 
Flask, allowing healthcare professionals to easily input patient data and receive predictions. 
Voice and speech models are trained and tested separately before being integrated, which 
enhances the framework's ability to accurately predict Parkinson's disease based on 
communication patterns. This project not only aims to improve diagnostic accuracy but also 
provides a valuable tool for continuous disease monitoring, helping to track progression and 
support more personalized treatment approaches.
